# TODO

- Use Texture.Load() instead of Sampling using the point sampling for a tiny perf boost where we don't need sampling

- For some reason the cube map generator smears the textures on the poles a bit, while the original one made them 'pointy'
- It also looks like the HDR images are too light?
